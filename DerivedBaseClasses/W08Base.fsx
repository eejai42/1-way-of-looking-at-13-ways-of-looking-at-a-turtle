W08: Batch oriented -- Using a state monad (computation expression)

In this design, the client uses the FP Turtle functions directly.

As before, the client must keep track of the current state and pass it into the next function call,
but this time the state is kept out of sight by using a State monad (called `turtle` computation expression here)

As a result, there are no mutables anywhere.
